       "'Task decomposition for Large Language Model (LLM) agents refers to the process of breaking down a complex, high-level goal or objective into a series of smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. This decomposition is crucial for enabling LLM agents to effectively tackle tasks that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and execution. Instead of attempting to directly address the entire complex task in a single step, the LLM agent leverages its reasoning capabilities to identify the constituent sub-tasks, define their dependencies, and then sequentially address each sub-task. This modular approach not only simplifies the overall problem but also allows for error recovery, progress tracking, and the integration of external tools or knowledge sources at each sub-task level. Effective task decomposition often involves defining clear criteria for sub-task completion, specifying the information required for each sub-task, and determining the optimal order in which the sub-tasks should be executed to achieve the overall goal. Different strategies for task decomposition exist, including hierarchical planning, chain-of-thought prompting, and the use of specialized planning modules, each with its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the nature of the task and the capabilities of the LLM agent.'"

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.'),\n",

This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:'),\n",
